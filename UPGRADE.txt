Aegir Upgrade Instructions
==========================

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This document describes briefly how to upgrade an existing Aegir installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conventions and tips
====================

All instructions and in general all commands must be run as aegir user, so all
permissions are always set correctly.

To become aegir user you can issue this command::

  su -s /bin/sh aegir

(Note you must run this as root or prefix with sudo).

Note that /bin/sh is an example. You may wish to instead use the shell of your
choice, i.e /bin/bash

Additionally to make following instructions generic and not dependant on a
concrete Drupal or Aegir version, we will use shell environment
variables. Since 0.4, the hostmaster platform is prepended with 'hostmaster'
so as not to clash with any other Drupal platforms. If you are upgrading from
Aegir version 0.3, your hostmaster platform may be called 'drupal-6.14'.

You should replace the following variables for current versions at the time
you are reading this document.

Shell commands::

  export AEGIR_VERSION=HEAD
  export DRUPAL_DIR=/var/aegir/hostmaster-$AEGIR_TAG
  export OLD_DRUPAL_DIR=/var/aegir/drupal-6.14
  export DRUSH_VERSION=6.x-3.0-alpha1.tar.gz
  export DRUSH_MAKE_VERSION=6.x-2.0-beta6

This document also assumes drush is installed properly and we use an
environment variable to simplify the documentation again.

Shell commands::

  export DRUSH='php /var/aegir/drush/drush.php'

As of the 0.4-alpha3 release, 'unzip' is a required dependency on your server
in order to successfully extract the jquery.ui library that is part of some UI
improvements. On Debian, this means:

Shell commands::

 apt-get install unzip

If you intend on upgrading your system to the bleeding edge version of the
code from our git repositories, you will need the git program installed.  On
Debian, this means:

Shell commands::

 apt-get install git-core

Generic upgrade instructions
============================

We aim to create a generic upgrade process that will be consistent across
versions. This section describes this process. However, there are
version-specific upgrade instructions that may be more relevant to your
installation in the next section.

Upgrading the backend
---------------------

In general, we try to keep the backend and the frontend compatible with each
other during release cycles. That is: provision 0.3 and hosting 0.3 will
always be able to talk to each other. hosting 0.2 was able to talk to
provision 0.3 too, but the API is not well enough defined so that can be
counted upon.

Therefore, you want to keep the frontend and the backend in sync. When you do
a major upgrade (e.g. 0.3 -> 0.4) of the backend, you *must* upgrade the
frontend soon after.

Bottomline: first you upgrade the backend, then the frontend.

Upgrading the backend is as simple as installing a new version of Drush and
Provision over the old ones.

Keep a copy of the old Provision and Drush in case something goes wrong in the
frontend.

Shell commands::

  cd /var/aegir
  mv drush drush.bak
  wget http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drush-$DRUSH_VERSION.tar.gz 
  gunzip -c drush-$DRUSH_VERSION.tar.gz | tar -xf -
  rm drush-$DRUSH_VERSION.tar.gz
  cd /var/aegir/.drush
  mv provision ../provision.bak
  wget http://files.aegirproject.org/provision-$AEGIR_VERSION.tgz
  gunzip -c provision-$AEGIR_VERSION.tgz | tar -xf -
  rm provision-$AEGIR_VERSION.tgz

Provision 0.4 has added a new dependency on drush_make, which will also need
to be installed to upgrade the front end if you are upgrading from a pre-0.4
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier 0.4 release, replace your copy of
drush_make with the latest recommended release.

Shell commands::

  $DRUSH dl drush_make-$DRUSH_MAKE_VERSION --destination='/var/aegir/.drush'

Upgrading the frontend
----------------------

These are generic instructions to upgrade your hosting, hostmaster, eldir or
Drupal core installation to new versions. As of 0.4 this process has largely
been automated, and will be able to upgrade 0.3 and any of the 0.4 development
releases to the latest applicable versions.

Once you have upgraded the backend, and you have installed drush_make you will
need to run the hostmaster migrate command.


Shell commands::

  cd $OLD_DRUPAL_DIR
  $DRUSH hostmaster-migrate aegir.example.com $DRUPAL_DIR

The directory specified must be an absolute path to where you want the new
release to be stored. If the directory does not exist, provision will use
drush_make to fetch and assemble the correct version of the front end for the
specific release of the backend you are running.

This command will completely replace the crontab entry for the aegir user, and
asks for confirmation before it does so. If you do not confirm, the process
will be halted as it is necessary for the task queue to be processed.

The command above will fetch the latest stable Drupal release, so it can
simply be run again when a new security release of Drupal is made available.

Version-specific upgrade notes
==============================

0.4 - multi server support
--------------------------

This release introduces multi-server support and required reorganizing
the Apache configuration files in ~aegir/config. Instead of having all
files in config/vhost.d, they are now split between vhost.d, platform.d
and a single apache.conf. The vhost.d directory is for virtual hosts,
platform.d is for platform-specific configuration and apache.conf is the
server-wide configuration file.

After you have completed the migration process as outlined above, 
you will need to change the line you added to the httpd.conf file during
installation.

Open your httpd.conf file and modify :

  Include /var/aegir/config/vhost.d/*

To read :

  Include /var/aegir/config/apache.conf

Now log into Aegir, and verify the hostmaster platform, this will generate
the correct apache.conf file and restart apache.
