aegir2-provision (2.0~rc5.1) testing; urgency=low

  * rebuild package with all makefiles and modules

 -- Antoine Beaupré <anarcat@debian.org>  Thu, 17 Oct 2013 16:15:42 -0400

aegir2-provision (2.0~rc5) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release ships a ton of bugfixes we have found in RC4. We also
    finalised subdirectory support which, while it still has some issues,
    is now actually working correctly, even on multiple servers. The IP
    allocation code for SSL on multiple servers was also fixed, making
    this probably the most solid multi-server Aegir release ever. We also
    did some API cleanups that seemed necessary before the final 2.0
    release.
  * Finally, we should also mentionned that the install process was
    significantly sped up thanks to the use of Drupal.org distributions to
    ship a single tarball for the hostmaster platform instead of using a
    makefile to build it from its parts all the times. During out tests,
    the platform make step went from 60 seconds to 1.5 seconds, an amazing
    improvement!
  * Note that the binary package name changes here

aegir-provision2 (2.0~rc3) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release mainly fixes a couple critical bugs in 2.0-rc2 that were
    causing problems when sites were being cloned or renamed.
  * We've added a couple small features, such as additional options during
    hostmaster-install, and allowing the redirect to the Welcome page to be
    turned off.
  * Also, we've made a small addition to the API, in that there is now a hook
    available (hook_provision_drupal_create_directories_alter()) to allow
    altering the directories created when a site installed.

 -- Christopher Gervais <chris@ergonlogic.com>  Thu, 29 Aug 2013 11:53:43 -0400

  * This release mainly targets a few critical bugs that were found in the
    second beta, mostly related to ongoing Views and Drush integration and
    access control. We also introduce a number of new features and finally
    drop support for provisionning Drupal 5 sites completely.

aegir-provision2 (2.0~beta2) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release mainly targets a few critical bugs that were found in the
    first beta, namely IP allocation on non-SSL and non-cluster sites
    which was completely broken, some problems with the new views
    integration and the Debian package.
  * We also introduce a few new features and finally drop support for
    provisionning Drupal 5 sites completely.
  * Full release notes at http://community.aegirproject.org/2.0-beta2

aegir-provision2 (2.0~alpha2) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release features improvements to the IP management mechanisms that
    were broken in the last alpha1 release. We now manage IP addresses
    individually, and check if an IP is in use before allowing it to be
    deleted.

  * We also finally leave the files alone on spokes in the multi-server
    model, a long-standing bug in the 1.x series that led to data loss. A
    lot of work was done to standardize the Nginx configuration to allow
    for simpler, yet optional, configurations that leave the admin in
    charge of choosing the optimisation methods. This is still work in
    progress, tracked in #1635596: nginx: do not decide the policy for
    users.

 -- Antoine Beaupré <anarcat@debian.org>  Thu, 16 May 2013 19:13:17 -0400

aegir-provision2 (2.0~alpha1) unstable; urgency=low

  * first alpha release of the 2.x branch, release notes too long to

 -- Antoine Beaupré <anarcat@debian.org>  Thu, 07 Feb 2013 16:52:49 -0500

aegir-provision (2.0~0.0alpha0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * switch to a native package
  
    while Aegir is desgined to run on other systems than Debian, it is
    currently *not* uploaded into Debian itself, and therefore there is
    only one source of packages, debian.aegirproject.org.

    this will mean we will need to make a new release every time we want
    to publish changes to the Debian package, but this annoyance
    outweights the trouble of having to maintain 4 different branches
    (1.x, 2.x and debian, debian2x) to have a 2.x debian package.

 -- Antoine Beaupré <anarcat@debian.org>  Tue, 06 Mar 2012 14:39:41 -0500
